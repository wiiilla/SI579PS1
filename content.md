# My Favorite Things

Bubbly squashes and flat rice dumplings,
Big ass tomatoes and mini chewy cookies,
Boba tea posicles its brown sugar dripping,
These are a few of my favorite things.

When the flower bloom,
When the cake steam,
When I'm enjoying life,
I simply snap my favorite things,
And show orrrff to friends!
